**prototype** of js client to openstack

goal is to work from both node and a browser

WARNING: THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY.  THE API CAN AND WILL CHANGE

QUICK TEST
----------

    node stack.js http://example.com:5000/v2.0 user password

Getting started on mac
----------------------

    brew install node
    curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
    npm install cli

NEXT STEPS:

 [ ] research how does backbone does async (make a basic backbone app with server crud)
 [ ] using keystone then "nova" is weird (js api improvements)
 [ ] abstract http requests so it can be used from node and browsers
